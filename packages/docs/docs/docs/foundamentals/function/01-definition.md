# Definition

In Mondrian you can define a function using the `@mondrian-framework/module` package. 
Everything you may need to define a new schema is enclosed inside the `functions`
namespace, so to get things started you should import it:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { functions } from '@mondrian-framework/model'
```
